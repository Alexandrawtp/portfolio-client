      As a former art historian in the art market field, I have always enjoyed
      playing with databases and enigmas.
      <p>
        I came to web development by chance, when one of my clients asked me for
        advice on how to build her website. At that time, I was doing some
        Python as an amateur, so I suggested her to try with a CMS.

        I then trained myself (thank you internet !), and completed my training
        with a web development bootcamp, Ironhack, which was one of the most
        rewarding experiences of my life.
